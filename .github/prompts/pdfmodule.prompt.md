Analyze my project currently open in this code base which is nextjs typescript project for pdf modifications. 

Now I want you to help me with updating UI. 
only focus on updating ui based styling. 

now in traditional and mordern pdf 
Add a sidebar that displays thumbnail previews of every PDF page. Users should be able to click a thumbnail to select and edit a page. The sidebar should support drag-and-drop for page reordering and provide clear visual navigation across multi-page documents, just like the page preview panel in all pdf editor. 
but make sure it compatible with out UI .
if possibel maintain glass effect.
