Analyze my project currently open in this code base which is nextjs typescript project for pdf modifications. 

Now I want significan UI improvements. 

Now firstly I want to make themes like 
multiple colour theme will be there
white, offwhite and one colour will be something 
for now focus on white theme 
white, off white shades use 
white, offwhite and one is yellow.

each theme will contain. 
3 colour shades. 
white, offwhite and one colour (in feature i will add for now make it yellow)

i want only these 3 colours to be used in whole website. the pdf editor with --color-slate-900 that should be thee's offwhite colour. 

make sure firstly settle the management of whole websites styling theme. 

i want to make it loook very modern and minimalistic.
features should be there but not like very in your face.
